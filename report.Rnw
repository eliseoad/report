\section{Executive summary}

Dear colleagues;

The following asthma surveillance update represents the Asthma Project effort to be as timely as possible in reporting asthma related health indicators and evidence the effort to design, implement, and sustain an ``Asthma Epidemiological Surveillance System".The data used for this update was the latest availbe at the Center for Disease, Control and Prevention web site at the date of publication.

Is of general knowlege that asthma is an important health issue in Puerto Rico.  The Puerto Rico Asthma Project has intensively worked to address this chronic condition from a public health perspective in collaboration with governmental, non-profit, profit and community based organizations to ahchive our goal of reduce the mortality and morbidity due to this condition, and incrase the quality of life of our population with asthma.

Sincerely,\\
\\

Francico Joglar Pesquera, MD

Puerto Rico Secretary of Health

\section{Author note}

\subsection{About this report}

This update reports is part of our commitment to continue learning and implementing cost-effective technological tools to improve this epidemiological surveillance system and enhancing its attributes of acceptability, flexibility, simplicity, stability, and timeliness and making important asthma information timely as possible. Is our expectation to work in producing an update as soon the data is available.  All updates will be included at at\\
\url{www.proyectoasmapr.org/Vigilancia.html}

We continue our effort in creating an easy to read and understand guide for public health planning and interventions.  With that aim, we are providing here what is so far our standard report with measures of the magnitude of a health indicators (e.g. prevalence, mortality, use of health services) across the different populations (e.g. age, sex, income, etc.) and the risk or possibility of having a health indicator (e.g. relative risk, odds ratios, etc.). The health indicator estimate is the proportion of individuals with the condition at the stratified group.  This measure can help with economic and human resources allocation. The risk is a burden guide for groups selection to prioritize interventions. Furthermore, you will find a document structure where in every page there is a brief interpretation on the observed health indicator, a brief interpretation of the risk measure followed by a graph and a table with the pertinent information.

\subsection{Peer review}

This document has been evaluated by the Puerto Rico Asthma Project Staff. We want you to take part in improving this surveillance system and reports. We encourage any reader to evaluate this document and send recommendations at\\
info@proyectoasmapr.org.\\

\subsection{Citation}

When use this document we suggest the following citation:

J.A. Bartolomei-D\'iaz and E. Acevedo. Puerto Rico asthma surveillance 2011 update.
Technical report, Puerto Rico Asthma Project, Puerto Rico Department of Health,
\today{}.\\

\subsection{Current version}

In this version (\today{}) you will find all the measures contained within the April 26, 2011 asthma report but using the 2011 Puerto Rico BRFSS data.  All procedures and methodologies in this updates are posted in our web page in a document title Puerto Rico Asthma surveillance methods.  Our standard report contains current asthma measures among adults and children stratified by socio-demographic, health related quality of life and risk factors. 

The 2011 BRFSS survey was conducted implementing a new sampling methodology.  Furhtermore, 2011 data can not be aggregated with those of previous years. The CDC strongly recomend to start a new trend from 2011 unwards. Please refere to the BRFSS official web site at \url{http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/} for details on methods changes.


\subsection{Next version}

We are in advance stages to finish our work towards obtaining asthma inidicators on medical interventions, asthma medication use, asthma education and asthma control. The information came from the follow-up asthma survey called the "Asthma Call Back" (ACB).

It is in on our best interest the extensive use of this information for public health policy, research questions \& proposal development.\\

Sincerely,\\

Jos\'{e} A. Bartolomei D\'{i}az, PhD

\subsection{Health related quality of life}
Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) measures are humanistic outcomes (ISPOR) recognized to supplement traditional measures of morbidity and mortality (CDC 2000; other). HRQOL have been previously used to describe the health perception of persons with asthma. Early studies by Juniper et al. described a relationship between asthma severity and quality of life impairment. \cite{Juniper_1992} Ford et al. (2003) found that persons with asthma reported worse health-related quality of life than respondents who previously had asthma or those who never had asthma \cite{Ford_2003}. Moreover, uncontrolled asthma has been linked to lower adult and pediatric HRQOL (Dean 2009). These measures are considered valid indicators of service need, interventions outcomes, support surveillance efforts for identifying health disparities and tracking population trends (CDC 2000). This section present the current asthma prevalence among adults within those who aswer the HRQOL questions.

\subsection{Risk \& comorbidities}

Based on the Dictionary of Epidemiology a behavioral risk factors are a characteristic of behavior that is associated with increased probability of a specified outcome; the term does not imply a causal relationship. \cite{Last_2001} A comorbidity is a disease(s) that coexist(s) in a study participant in addition to the index condition that is the subject of study. \cite{Last_2001}.  In this section we provides a brief description of risk factors and comorbid conditions that can guide hypothesis in understanding the burden of asthma in Puerto Rico.

\section{Remarks}

This report suggest that asthma in Puerto Rico should continue be considered a priority for the public health authorities in \Sexpr{set_Country}. An estimate of \Sexpr{format(data.frame(svytotal(~currasth, design = brfss.sd, na.rm = TRUE))[2, "total"], scientific = 1, big.mark = "," )} (\Sexpr{data.frame(svymean(~currasth, design = brfss.sd, na.rm = TRUE))[2, "mean"] * 100}\%) adult and \Sexpr{format(data.frame(svytotal(~ccurasth, design = cbrfss.sd, na.rm = TRUE))[2, "total"], scientific = 1, big.mark = ",")} (\Sexpr{data.frame(svymean(~ccurasth, design = cbrfss.sd, na.rm = TRUE))[2, "mean"] * 100}\%) children in Puerto Rico had \Sexpr{set_MeasureL} as of the period of \Sexpr{set_Years}. When evaluating by the socio-demographic variables, no specific group has been disproportionately affected with asthma prevalence in age groups, educational level or marital status. With regards to gender the asthma prevalence was \Sexpr{tabl.sex[2, "OR"]} times higher in women. Although not statistically significant those in the household income range of $35k-<50k$ and $50+$ had \Sexpr{1 - as.numeric(tabl.incomg["35k-<50k", "OR"])} and \Sexpr{1 - as.numeric(tabl.incomg["50+k", "OR"])} respectively less possibility of \Sexpr{set_MeasureL} that the group in the $<15k$ income range.


Moving to the health related quality of life measures, the possibility of reporting \Sexpr{set_MeasureL} in adults that perceived their health as fair or poor was \Sexpr{tabl.fairpoor[2, "OR"]} times higher than those who considered their health as good, very good or excellent. The adults who said that they felt physically bad for 14 days or more for the last 30 days had \Sexpr{tabl.physhlcat[2, "OR"]} times higher possibility of report \Sexpr{set_MeasureL} than those reporting less than 13 days. In the same manner, adults who felt mentally distress for 14 days or more in a month had \Sexpr{tabl.mentdist[2, "OR"]} times higher possibility of report \Sexpr{set_MeasureL} than those reporting less than 13 days. From 1.6 million adults who were unable to carry on with their normal activities more than 14 days in a month \Sexpr{tabl.unhlthy[2, "Prevalence"]} percent reported \Sexpr{set_MeasureL}. 

People who exercise, or are exposed to physical activities reported \Sexpr{1 - as.numeric(tabl.exerany2["No", "OR"])} \% higher risk than those who don't.  Regarding, body mass index (BMI) those obese and overweight had \Sexpr{1 - as.numeric(tabl.bmi4cat[2, "OR"])}\% and \Sexpr{as.numeric(tabl.bmi4cat[3, "OR"]) - 1}\% more possibility of \Sexpr{set_MeasureL} than those neither obese nor overweight. The estimation of the \Sexpr{set_MeasureL} on smokers was \Sexpr{tabl.rfsmok3[c("Yes"),1]} percent.  Adults with diabetes were \Sexpr{1 -  as.numeric(tabl.diabetes[2, "OR"])}\5 less likely to have \Sexpr{set_MeasureL} than their counterpart.

%OR in asthma among children was evaluated using the information provided by their parents. Sociodemographic variables shown in this part of the report are not directly related to the child but to the parent, but understanding that the child is also exposed to the sociodemographic status of their parent, we use it as their own. 

Regarding children estimates those in the \Sexpr{rownames(tabl.cageg)[2]} age group reported a \Sexpr{set_MeasureL} of \Sexpr{tabl.cageg[2,1]} percent. \Sexpr{print(toString(floor(as.numeric(tabl.cageg[2, 2]) * t.current.child.age[2,c("prev")])))} \Sexpr{rownames(tabl.csexg)[1]} children have a \Sexpr{t.current.child.sex[c("Male"), c("prev")] / t.current.child.sex[c("Female"),c("prev")]} times higher \Sexpr{set_MeasureL} than their counterpart. Children whose parents annual income is less than \$15,000, reported to have a \Sexpr{set_MeasureL} of \Sexpr{tabl.cincomg[1,1]} percent.  Among employment status, The only group with significant difference was the \Sexpr{names(which.min(tabl.cemplrec2[, "OR"]))} group with \Sexpr{min(tabl.cemplrec2[, "OR"])} less possibility of \Sexpr{set_MeasureL} than the reference group.

%The population estimations presented in each table for the different years, where calculated with the total estimate population by the BRFSS for each year. Approximately, 151,325 adults in Puerto Rico could not complete their daily activities (work, studies, etc.) in the year 2010 due to physical or mental unhealthiness in the month before they were interviewed, 30,140 of which were absent for at least 14 days of that month. Approximately 140,500 of the persons in Puerto Rico that perceive their health as \Sexpr{tolower(rownames(t.asma.current.hrqol)[2])}, had \Sexpr{set_MeasureL} in 2010. For the year 2010, approximately 87,355 persons in \Sexpr{set_Country} with other chronic diseases (stroke, heart problems, etc.) also had asthma. 

%\newpage
%\vspace{1cm}

Progress has been made in understanding the burden of asthma in \Sexpr{set_Country}. Advancements in the diagnose and treatment of the condition have had considerably improve in the last 20 years, but it still an uncontrolled condition. The disclosed information is part of the effort of the Puerto Rico Asthma Project to provide an update of the state of asthma in our country. The report present information that can aid in the development of public policy, guide changes in the health care system, monitor population asthma control, enhance educational material, and guide all efforts to target factors of disparities as a way of reducing morbidity and mortality associated with asthma in \Sexpr{set_Country}.
